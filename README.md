# Modeling and Visualizing PBMC Clustering and Temporal Dynamics Using a Transition Model

This project aims to model and visualize the clustering and temporal dynamics of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) to simulate the behavior and transitions of different immune cell subpopulations over time under various conditions, such as infections, immune responses, or treatments.

## Requirements

## Data Preparation

## Running the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**  
   Open a terminal and change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/Clustering-PBMCs-using-TransitionModel

2. **Run the Main Script**
   Execute the main Python script to start the analysis:

   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```
